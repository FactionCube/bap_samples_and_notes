A demonstration of how to over-write a buffer pointer using 'primus lisp'. The file, 'setup.lisp', shows how to do this. It will over-write a pointer defined within the executable with a pointer to a buffer which has been created by a call to 'malloc' from within the lisp file.  Additionally, a string of bytes ('ABCDEFGH') are written into the lisp buffer, and you can then see that they are printed to 'stdout' when 'bap' is run ('bap ./a.out --recipe=recipe.scm').
